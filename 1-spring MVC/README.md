Spring MVC is the foundation for building web applications in Spring Boot. Once you understand how to create controllers, handle HTTP requests, and return responses, everything else (Security, Data JPA, etc.) builds naturally on top of it.

Why start with Spring MVC?

It's the foundation - you need to understand how to build web endpoints first
Everything else builds on top of it (Security secures your MVC endpoints, JPA provides data to your controllers)
You see results immediately - make an endpoint, test it in your browser!

The learning path I recommend:

Spring MVC (start here!) ← you're here now
Spring Data JPA + Hibernate (connect to databases)
Spring Security (secure your endpoints)
Jakarta API (standard APIs used by Spring)

The tutorial above walks you through 6 sections with real code examples. Each section builds on the previous one, ending with a complete Task Manager API.
To practice right now:

Create a new Spring Boot project at start.spring.io
Add "Spring Web" dependency
Copy the code examples from section 2 and try them!
