# What is Spring MVC?
Spring MVC is the foundation for building web applications in Spring Boot. Once you understand how to create controllers, handle HTTP requests, and return responses, 
everything else (Security, Data JPA, etc.) builds naturally on top of it.

# Why Start with Spring MVC?

## 🎯 The Foundation
Spring MVC is the perfect starting point for learning Spring Boot because:

1. **It's the foundation** - You need to understand how to build web endpoints first
2. **Everything else builds on top of it** - Security secures your MVC endpoints, JPA provides data to your controllers
3. **You see results immediately** - Make an endpoint, test it in your browser!

## 📚 Recommended Learning Path

### 1. Spring MVC ⭐ **(You're here now!)**
   - HTTP request handling
   - Controller annotations (`@RestController`, `@GetMapping`, etc.)
   - Request/response mapping
   - Path variables and query parameters

### 2. Spring Data JPA + Hibernate
   - Database connectivity
   - Entity mapping
   - Repository pattern
   - CRUD operations

### 3. Spring Security
   - Authentication & authorization
   - Securing endpoints
   - User management
   - JWT tokens

### 4. Jakarta API
   - Standard APIs used by Spring
   - Enterprise Java standards
   - Web services

## 🚀 Get Started Now!

This tutorial walks you through **6 sections** with real code examples. Each section builds on the previous one, ending with a complete Task Manager API.

### To Practice Right Now:

1. **Create a new Spring Boot project** at [start.spring.io](https://start.spring.io)
2. **Add "Spring Web" dependency**
3. **Copy the code examples** from section 2 and try them!
